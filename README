This is the story of connection in a lonely universe.

The universe is very big.
Here it is:

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Wow! Look at all those stars!

                              ^
                              |
        And over at this end is 
                   (2^64, 2^64)

We are very small.
Here we are:

.

This is the human race! How miniscule! 
The universe cares not for such an insignificant speck.

Here is our planet:

#~#~
^~=~
~~~~

It has deserts =, oceans ~, mountains ^, and plains #.
It's a pretty good one.

There are other planets like ours out there somewhere
But there aren't very many of them
And the universe has enough space to hold 2^64 * 2^64 of them! 
Or, if we do the math:

                (2^64 * 2^64)
18446744073709551616L * 18446744073709551616L
  340282366920938463463374607431768211456L

of them. Wow!
Can 2 such dots can meet in such a giant universe of stars?
